# Hi! 👋

I am a student at the Technical University in Košice, specializing in computer science. At the moment I have already received my bachelor's degree in automotive electronics, and I will receive my master's degree in informatics. I am interested in developing different kinds of SW in C++ and Python and have experience with open source projects in this field for about a year. 

## 📌 About Me:
